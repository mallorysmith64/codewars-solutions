// Name of Problem: Categorize New Member

// Instructions: The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. 
// They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.
// To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. 
// In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

// Input will consist of a list of lists containing two items each. Each list contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.
// Note for F#: The input will be of (int list list) which is a List<List>
// Example Input: [[18, 20],[45, 2],[61, 12],[37, 6],[21, 21],[78, 9]]

// Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.
// Example Output: ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

// Solution:
const openOrSenior = data => {
  return data.map(x => {
    if (x[0] >= 55 && x[1] > 7) {
      return 'Senior'
    } else {
      return 'Open'
    }
  })
}

// Test.assertSimilar(openOrSenior([[45, 12],[55,21],[19, -2],[104, 20]]),['Open', 'Senior', 'Open', 'Senior'])
// Test.assertSimilar(openOrSenior([[3, 12],[55,1],[91, -2],[54, 23]]),['Open', 'Open', 'Open', 'Open'])
// Test.assertSimilar(openOrSenior([[59, 12],[55,-1],[12, -2],[12, 12]]),['Senior', 'Open', 'Open', 'Open'])
