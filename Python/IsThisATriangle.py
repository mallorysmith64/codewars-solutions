# Language: Python
# Level: 7kyu
# Name of Problem: Is this a triangle?

# Instructions: Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. 
# The method should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.
# (In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).

# Solution 1:
def is_triangle(a, b, c):
    return a + b > c and b + c > a and c + a > b

# Solution 2:
# def is_triangle(a, b, c):
#     return a - b < c and b - c < a and c - a < b

# Solution 3:
# def is_triangle(a, b, c):
#     if a + b > c and b + c > a and c + a > b:
#       return True
#     else:
#       return False
