# Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software
# Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. 
# Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

# When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), 
# are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

# Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. 
# You only have to handle the following mistakes:

# S is misinterpreted as 5
# O is misinterpreted as 0
# I is misinterpreted as 1

def correct(s):
    return s.replace("5", "S").replace("0","O").replace("1", "I")


# 5 would be old. S would be new. You can chain replace() together.
# replace(old_value, new_value)
